    Hi, there:<br>
    I'm Harry Ying. Because of the danger of the SMS, I'll change the way of communication.<br>
    <br>
    And you should follow the following steps to generate a key which can encrypt and decrypt the message.<br>
    Before we start, I define \(p=30\), \(g=7\), \(A=13\).<br>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    step 1) select an arbitrary number(as big as you can) \(b\) (e.g. \(5\) or \(34\)). calculate $$B=g^{b}\ mod\ p$$
    Then tell me the \(B\) by SMS.<br>
    (mod is a kind of calculation, \(7\ mod\ 3=1\), \(6\ mod\ 3=0\), \(8\ mod\ 2=0\), \(17\ mod\ 3=2\). I think you know what it is.)<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    step 2) And you can get the key by this equation:
    $$K=A^{b}\ mod\ p$$
    The \(K\) you've got will be the key. We'll get the same key which can't be stolen. Maths proves it.<br>

    That's it! It's really easy, isn't it?<br>
    Now, go <a href="https://cryptobin.co/">here</a>. Type the message and input the key below, set the Expiration Time as never.<br>
    Just click "bin it" below.
    Give me the link of the page, then I can decrypt it by the key. The message is encrypted by the AES-256 method so no one can decrypt it unless he knows the key.<br>
    <br>
    I've encrypted a message, the key is 30's prime factors.

    中文注释： mod的含义是取一个数除以另一个数的余数<br>
    prime factor的含义是质因数
